## Test Suite Statistics

| Difficulty Level | Test Count | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Easy | 23 | Basic test cases with simple inputs |
| ðŸŸ¡ Medium | 17 | Moderate complexity with edge cases |
| ðŸ”´ Hard | 25 | Complex scenarios and performance tests |
| ðŸŸ£ Expert | 15 | Advanced algorithms with larger datasets |
| âš« Extreme | 13 | Maximum complexity with performance constraints |
| **Total** | **93** | **Comprehensive test coverage** |

## Key Improvements

1. **Expanded Coverage**: Increased test count by 39% (67 â†’ 93 tests)
2. **Scalability Testing**: Added large dataset handling
3. **Performance Validation**: Strict timing constraints for complex operations
